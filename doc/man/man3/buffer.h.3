.PP 
Definition for the shared buffer used by the consumer and relay\&. 

The memory shared between the consumer and relay consists of a double buffer with status fields for each buffer\&. To begin, both buffers are set to be empty\&. The consumer will then fill begin filling an empty buffer\&. When the buffer is full, the \fBST_BUFFER_EMPTY\fP flag shall be unset for that buffer\&. This must happen \fIafter\fP any interaction with the buffer is complete, or else a race condition could occur\&. The relay will find any full buffer and begin to empty it\&. When this buffer is empty, the buffer empty flag shall be reset for that buffer\&. Again, this must happen \fIafter\fP any interaction with the buffer is complete, or else a race condition could occur\&.
